# LISTS
# ===================================================================
# A list is a compound data type: you can group values together:
# area variables (in square meters)
hall = 11.25
kit = 18.0
liv = 20.0
bed = 10.75
bath = 9.50
# Create list areas
areas = [hall, kit, liv, bed, bath]
# Print areas
print(areas)
# Can you tell which ones of the following lines of Python code are valid ways to build a list?
# A. [1, 3, 4, 2]
# B. [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 7]]
# C. [1 + 2, "a" * 5, 3]
# Answer = ALL
