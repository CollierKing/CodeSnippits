# ELSE Clause in FOR loop
# The main use case for this behaviour is to implement search loops, where youâ€™re performing a search for an item that meets a particular condition, and need to perform additional processing or raise an informative error if no acceptable value is found:
for x in data:
    if acceptable(x):
        break
else:
    raise ValueError("No acceptable value in {!r:100}".format(data))
# But how do I check if my loop never ran at all?
# The easiest way to check if a for loop never executed is to use None as a sentinel value:
x = None
for x in data:
    # process x
    print(x)
if x is None:
    raise ValueError("Empty data iterable: {!r:100}".format(data))

# A list comprehension is a syntactic construct that enables lists to be created from other lists using a compact, mathematical syntax:

[x**2 for x in numbers if x**2 > 8]
# [9, 16]
[(x, x**2, x**3) for x in numbers]
# [(1, 1, 1), (2, 4, 8), (3, 9, 27), (4, 16, 64)]
